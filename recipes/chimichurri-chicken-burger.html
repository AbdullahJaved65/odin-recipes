        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          We fixed the chicken burger, and all it really took was stirring in a
          couple spoons of chimichurri sauce. No longer sort of dry and kind of
          boring, this is one of the best burgers you'll ever have.

          If you showed up at a cookout where you heard they were making
          burgers, but once you got there you realized they were talking about
          chicken burgers, would you be excited or profoundly disappointed?
          That’s what I thought. Me too. When your mouth is ready for juicy and
          flavorful, something dry and bland just won’t do, which is why I was
          so thrilled with how these chimichurri chicken burgers turned out.
          They weren’t just comparable, but maybe even…better? Okay, that might
          be a stretch, but the fact that I was even having those thoughts is a
          great indication of just how much I enjoyed these.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 cup Italian parsley leaves</li>
          <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
          <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
          <li>4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Spiking the “ground” chicken meat with chimichurri not only made for
            an extremely tasty burger, but it also added a nice richness, which
            is not usually the case when cattle aren’t involved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be careful not to overcook these, since they aren’t as forgiving as
            a fatty beef burger, and at a certain point they’ll become dry and
            chalky no matter what you’ve added. I think pan frying is best,
            although these can also be seared under a hot broiler.
          </li>
          <li>
            They might be a little fragile to place on the grill raw, unless you
            partially cook them in a pan first. I haven’t tested that, but I
            hope to soon, since I’ll definitely be making these again.
